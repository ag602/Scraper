      "Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that cannot be stored or made in the body, so a regular intake is required. It plays many beneficial roles including the normal function of the immune system, normal formation of collagen for normal skin function, and the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. If you feel you are not getting enough from your diet, a supplement could help safeguard your intake and Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps in intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, which in turn have multiple biological effects. Vitamin D is made by the body when the skin is exposed to sunlight. The oral flavoured strips of Vitamin D are helpful in maintaining the exact amount of Vitamin D in your body. With the added advantage of Curcumin which is an active ingredient in Turmeric and has many scientifically proven health benefits, such as the potential to prevent heart disease, Alzheimer's and cancer. This is now offered in the form of an oral strip, which is easy to use and is most effective due to direct access to the bloodstream.\n",

      "Omega 3 Fish Oil Contains both Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Omega-3 fatty acids are essential nutrients that are important in preventing and managing heart disease. It helps to maintain a healthy body for overall wellness. It supports health of joints by promoting flexibility, mobility and pain relief and also supports muscle protein synthesis, improves post-workout recovery and reduces exercise-induced joint stiffness. Omega-3 is a great way to maintain healthy levels of EPA and DHA. Not all fats are unhealthy omega 3 EPA and DHA fatty acids are one of the \"good\" types of fatty acids. Fatty acids from food such as cold water fish is the best source of omega 3 fish oil. However, if you do not like to eat fish, dietary supplements are an alternative source of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids. Many people claim that they notice a difference in how they feel. Your body can't make these types of fatty acids, you obtain them through foods you eat or by taking it in a supplement form. Each capsule of the healthvit omega 3 has the right amount of nutrients to give you your daily requirement of omega 3 fatty acids.\n",
